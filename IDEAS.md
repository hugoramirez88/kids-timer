# Ideas & Improvements

> Capture ideas here during development. Periodically triage into ROADMAP.md or discard.

## UX/Design Ideas
<!-- Visual improvements, interaction refinements -->

## Feature Ideas
<!-- New functionality suggestions -->

## Code Quality
<!-- Refactoring opportunities, technical debt -->
- Consider extracting profile modals from App.vue if it grows further
- Consider shared button CSS classes for consistency (`.btn-selectable`)
- Timer-to-music sync could move to timer store (low priority)
- Migrate PWA to `vite-plugin-pwa` for automatic cache versioning and workbox integration

## Testing Ideas
<!-- Test coverage gaps, automation opportunities -->
- Add visual regression tests with screenshots
- Add performance benchmarks for timer accuracy
- CI/CD integration for automated test runs

## Performance
<!-- Optimization opportunities -->
